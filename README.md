# pascal-mastermind
An implementation of the classic board game mastermind - originally written when I was 15!

Now at 30, with a high school programming class, college Computer Science degree and 8 years of professional software engineering experience, I've dug up this code from my dropbox and am trying to (1) understand it, (2) rebuild it to my current standard, (3) do something crazy - containerize, publish, something.
